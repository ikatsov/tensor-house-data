<h1>The latest and greatest: meet Pixel 7 and Pixel 7 Pro</h1>

The redesigned Pixel 7 and Pixel 7 Pro are here. Powered by our next-generation Google Tensor G2 processor and shipping with Android 13, these phones are at the center of our ever-expanding hardware portfolio that also includes a watch, tablet and earbuds. All of these devices come with the smarts you expect from Google and work together to help you.

<h2>Our sleekest design yet</h2>
Pixel 7 and Pixel 7 Pro are sleek, sophisticated and durable. Plus the aluminum enclosure for both phones is made of 100% recycled content.

With a 6.3-inch display and smaller bezels, Pixel 7 is purposefully more compact than Pixel 6 ‚Äî packing more features and improvements into a smaller profile. Its new zirconia-blasted aluminum feels silky in your hand, and you can choose from three colors to suit your personal style: Snow, Obsidian and brand new Lemongrass.

Pixel 7 Pro has a 6.7-inch immersive display, a beautiful polished aluminum frame and a camera bar that‚Äôs perfectly complemented by the three color options: Snow, Obsidian and a new Hazel color.

<h2>Android 13 on Pixel 7</h2>
Android 13 on Pixel 7 brings you the best Android experience yet. It‚Äôs fast, smart and secure. Plus, the fresh new style and customization capabilities make it feel unique to you. You can recolor the look of your app icons to match the aesthetic of your phone‚Äôs wallpaper, and even assign specific languages to individual apps.

An even better camera (if you can believe it)
Say hello to the best picture-taking experience on a Pixel phone yet. Here are five camera features you don‚Äôt want to miss:

<ul>
    <li>Extend your range with our next-generation Super Res Zoom up to 8x on Pixel 7 and up to 30x on Pixel 7 Pro. You‚Äôll be able to get sharp, quality images from a distance, so your friends will think you were courtside when you show them the pictures you took of your sports hero in action. We‚Äôve also achieved optical quality similar to a dedicated 2x telephoto lens for Pixel 7 and a 10x telephoto lens for Pixel 7 Pro, so you have the flexibility to creatively frame your shot at multiple magnifications while maintaining high quality.</li>
    
    <li>Use Pixel 7 Pro to get even closer with Macro Focus, which delivers Pixel HDR+ photo quality from as close as three centimeters away. Take photos of flower petals, raindrops, feathers and other tiny details with full sharpness and vivid color.</li>

    <li>Bring your blurry photos back to life with Photo Unblur, a Google Photos feature only on Pixel 7 and Pixel 7 Pro. Photo Unblur uses machine learning to improve your blurry pictures ‚Äî even old ones. With just a few taps, remove blur and visual noise so you can relive the moment as clearly as you remember it. And you can also touch up those photos and easily remove distractions with Magic Eraser.</li>

    <li>We all love taking selfies. With Guided Frame, those who are blind or low-vision are now able to capture selfies with a combination of precise audio guidance, high-contrast visual animations and haptic feedback. Because selfies should be for everyone.</li>
        
    <li>Videos are getting an upgrade with new 10-bit HDR. Record brighter, higher contrast videos with wider color ranges. And Cinematic Blur lets you shoot cinema-like videos with beautiful, shallow depth-of-field.</li>

</ul>

We‚Äôve also made updates to the things you already love about Pixel‚Äôs camera, our most inclusive camera to date. Real Tone‚Äôs camera algorithms have been trained with more than 10,000 additional portraits of people of color from our image expert partners to make sure that Pixel Camera consistently renders skin tones authentically. With this, we‚Äôve improved Real Tone to work in low-light settings including Night Sight. And Night Sight now only needs half of the normal exposure time to produce beautiful low-light images that are sharper than before. You can read a recap of all of our new camera features here.

<h2>Smarts and speech</h2>
Google‚Äôs smarts and intelligence is a big part of what makes a Pixel, a Pixel, and Pixel 7 is no different. With Google Tensor G2, we've improved almost every major subsystem in the chip, and we‚Äôve designed them to work really well together to handle the nuanced and complex nature of our software and machine learning. So your smartphone is even smarter, especially when it comes to understanding speech and language.

It can be frustrating when you call a business and have to memorize all the options for the extension you need, which is why we launched Direct My Call last year. This feature just got better with Pixel 7: For many of the most-called businesses, you‚Äôll now be able to see a list of menu options before they‚Äôre even spoken, so you can cancel that flight or file an insurance claim even faster.

Texting just got more fun with Assistant voice typing, which now automatically suggests emojis that are relevant to your messages. You can also search for emojis with your voice.8 Don‚Äôt worry if you don‚Äôt know the name of the emoji you‚Äôre looking for. It‚Äôs forgiving, so ‚Äúhey emoji‚Äù üëã, ‚Äúwinky emoji‚Äù üòú ‚Äã‚Äãor ‚ÄúLOL emoji‚Äù üòÇ, for example, will work just fine. Plus, Assistant voice typing is now available in French, Italian and Spanish, in addition to English, German, and Japanese.

Voice messages are great, but you‚Äôre not always in a great place to listen to one. With Pixel 7‚Äôs speech recognition technology, your phone can now transcribe voice messages on Google‚Äôs Messages app, so you can easily read them as soon as you receive them.

<h2>Safe and secure with 7</h2>
As always, your personal information is protected with Pixel. With Google Tensor G2 and the Titan M2 security chip, Pixel is built with multiple layers of security to help keep you safe and secure. Titan M2 makes your phone more resilient to sophisticated attacks. And later this year, Pixel 7 and Pixel 7 Pro will get VPN by Google One at no extra cost, so your online activity is protected no matter what app or web browser you use.

Pixel 7 and Pixel 7 Pro‚Äôs fast and secure under-display fingerprint reader makes unlocking your phone a breeze. And now, you‚Äôll have the added convenience of Face Unlock thanks to advanced machine learning models for face recognition, so you can quickly access what you need with just a glance.
