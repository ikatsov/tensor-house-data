Ingredient name: E441 Gelatin
Description: Gelatin is a protein derived from the collagen found in animal tissues, primarily from bones and skin. Here's a summary of its physical properties:
- Form: Gelatin is commonly available in the form of a translucent, colorless, or light yellow powder.
- Solubility: Gelatin is hydrophilic, meaning it readily dissolves in hot water. However, it forms a gel-like substance when cooled, which gives it its characteristic gelatinous texture.
- Gelling Ability: One of the most important physical properties of gelatin is its ability to form gels. When dissolved in hot water and cooled, it undergoes a reversible gelation process, where a gel network is formed, trapping water molecules within the matrix.
- Melting Point: Gelatin does not have a distinct melting point like many substances. Instead, its gels can transition between solid and liquid states over a range of temperatures.
- Texture and Mouthfeel: Gelatin gels have a smooth, soft texture, which provides a pleasant mouthfeel in various food products like desserts, gummy candies, and marshmallows.
- Amino Acid Composition: Gelatin is rich in amino acids, especially glycine, proline, and hydroxyproline, which contribute to its unique properties.
- Source: Gelatin is derived from animal collagen, often sourced from pigskin, cow hides, or bones.
- Bloom Strength: Gelatin's strength and ability to form gels are measured by its "bloom" value. Higher bloom values indicate stronger gelling properties.
- Water Holding Capacity: Gelatin has excellent water holding capacity, which is why it is used as a thickener and stabilizer in various food products.
- Applications: Gelatin is widely used in the food industry for producing gummy candies, desserts, soups, broths, and as a stabilizer in some dairy products. It is also used in pharmaceuticals, photography, cosmetics, and other industrial applications.
- Hygroscopicity: Gelatin is hygroscopic, meaning it can attract and retain moisture from the surrounding environment.

Ingredient name: E951 Aspartame
Description: Aspartame is an artificial sweetener that is widely used as a sugar substitute in various food and beverage products. Here's a summary of its physical properties:
- Form: Aspartame is a white, crystalline powder or granules.
- Sweetness: Aspartame is approximately 150 to 200 times sweeter than sucrose (table sugar), making it an intense sweetener.
- Solubility: Aspartame is highly soluble in water and dissolves readily in aqueous solutions.
- Stability: Aspartame is not heat-stable, and it can degrade at high temperatures or in acidic conditions. Therefore, it is often used in products that do not require prolonged exposure to heat or acidity.
- pH Sensitivity: Aspartame's sweetness can be affected by the pH level of the solution it is dissolved in. Its sweetness may decrease at low pH (acidic) levels and increase at high pH (alkaline) levels.
- Caloric Value: Aspartame is virtually calorie-free, as the human body does not metabolize it into energy like sugars or carbohydrates.
- Source: Aspartame is chemically synthesized and is not found naturally in foods.
- Taste Profile: Aspartame provides a clean, sweet taste without any bitter or metallic aftertaste.
- Decomposition: Aspartame can decompose under certain conditions, forming byproducts such as aspartylphenylalanine diketopiperazine (DKP) when exposed to heat and humidity. This decomposition can affect the taste and sweetness of products containing aspartame over time.
- Applications: Aspartame is commonly used as a sugar substitute in a wide range of products, including soft drinks, desserts, candies, chewing gum, and other low-calorie or sugar-free food items.
- Phenylalanine Concern: Aspartame contains the amino acid phenylalanine, which is a concern for individuals with phenylketonuria (PKU), a rare genetic disorder. PKU patients need to limit their phenylalanine intake, so they must avoid products containing aspartame.
